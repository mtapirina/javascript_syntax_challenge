# Javascript Syntax: Codecademy Challenge Projects:

 Challenge Project: Credit Card Checker
--------------------------------------

Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 
In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently 
checks using pencil and paper, but you’ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions 
and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

 Challenge Project: Mysterious Organism
------------------------------------

Project Goals
Context: You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean 
near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only 
comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the 
hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot 
survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. 
Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.
